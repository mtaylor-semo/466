\subsection*{External characters\footnote{Adapted from Pettingill, O.S., Jr. \textit{Ornithology in Laboratory and Field,} 4th ed.} (20 points)}

Taxonomic groups such as orders and families can often be diagnosed by combinations of external characters, such as bill shape and type of foot.  This exercises introduces you to many of these characters. You \emph{must} learn these characters. Key terms that you must also learn are defined when needed.

\subsubsection*{Instructions}

 Read the description of each character type and then sketch that character type in the space left of the description, or you may draw and label the character type on a separate sheet of paper. %Examples are provided but 
 You are not expected to make high quality illustrations. Do your best. \textbf{Station numbers in parentheses after each description.}
 
 %You can print this document and draw in the left column. You can draw on a separate sheet of paper but write the name of the character (e.g., crossed bill) next to your drawing.
 
% You may draw in the left column or draw on a separate sheet of paper but write the name of the character (e.g., crossed bill) next to your drawing.
 
 %You may use whatever resources you wish for examples of the character types. Text in \textsc{Small caps} are active links in the \textsc{pdf} file. Click on a link to go to that species's entry in Cornell's \href{https://www.allaboutbirds.org/}{All About Birds} guide. Skimming the photos on the \textsc{id} page will often show the specific character. In a few cases, links to specific photos are provided.
 
% Upload photos or scans of your drawings to the Lab~1 drop box by the due date.
