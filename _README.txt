Ideas for the future:

Most lectures are one hour or so, or can be structured as such. Fill time with field guide ID questions to get students digging into their field guides, learning how to look for characters, etc.

Field quizzes will be in-doors, given on some lecture days. They will consist of photo and audio identification.

First day will be field trip to Show-me Center or external characters lab. If field trip is first day, then lab on second day. Doing the external characters lab during the first week will set the stage for higher level taxonomy work every week.

Each week, feature one of the higher taxonomic groups of birds, probably most often to order and family. For each group, point out some of the taxonomic characters that unite them, relating them back to the external characters (e.g., bill type, foot type, etc.)

The goal will be to get students familiar with the birds as a whole. Some of this can be done in labs.

Probably skip the internal anatomy lab. Use it for other activities.
