Ground rules

A bird might be in this quiz as audio, image, or both as separate questions. Thus, you might need to use the same bird for one or two answers. 

No talking. Do not talk about birds you hear or see in the background.

We'll go over the answers after I have collected the quizzes.

Write each answer on a separate line.
